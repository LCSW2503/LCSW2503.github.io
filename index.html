            Tired of batteries that fizzle out faster than a wet firecracker?
            BOMB Batteries deliver an EXPLOSIVE punch of power that will keep
            your devices running until kingdom come (or warranty expiration,
            whichever comes first).
          </p>
          <p>
            With our proprietary blend of what we legally can neither confirm
            nor deny might be trace amounts of Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239,
            our batteries pack a punch measured in actual TNT equivalent!
          </p>
          <p>
            Don't settle for less when you can have BOMB - the #1 battery brand
            on the Syrian frontlines for 10 consecutive years!

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">
              What makes BOMB Batteries so revolutionary?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Our proprietary blend of Uranium-235 and Plutonium-239 delivers an
              astonishing 500 kiloton TNT equivalent of energy in every battery!
              While our competitors are still using boring lithium ions, we've
              harnessed the awesome power of atomic energy to create batteries
              that last longer than most international peace treaties. Our
              PowerBlast AA batteries can power your remote control for up to 47
              years straight or excavate a small canyon with a single discharge!

          </div>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Are BOMB Batteries safe?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Define "safe"! Our batteries have passed at least 3% of
              international safety protocols, which we consider a smashing
              success! Our "Minor Thermal Events" (industry term for small
              mushroom clouds) have decreased by 17% since 2022. Remember our
              slogan: "If it hasn't melted your device, it's not a BOMB
              Battery!" We do recommend keeping our products at least 200 feet
              from schools, hospitals, and nuclear power plants. Side effects
              may include mild radiation glow that eliminates the need for
              nightlights!

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">Where is BOMB Batteries based?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Our headquarters used to be in Nevada, but after our "enthusiastic
              product testing phase" in 2019, we relocated to a reinforced
              bunker beneath the Mojave Desert. Our manufacturing facilities are
              strategically located in remote areas that already have naturally
              occurring background radiation, which we call "pre-seasoned
              production environments." We're also proud to announce our newest
              underground facility in an undisclosed location that may or may
              not be visible from space due to the occasional atmospheric
              disturbance!

          <h2 class="faq-category">Product Information</h2>

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">What types of batteries do you sell?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Our explosive lineup includes the devastating DoomCell AAA (3
              megaton TNT equivalent), the catastrophic CataclysmCore AA (7
              megaton TNT equivalent), the earth-shattering ApocalypseCell C (12
              megaton TNT equivalent), and our flagship DestructoMax D battery
              (22 megaton TNT equivalent). For special applications, we offer
              the ThermoBurst 9V and our industrial-grade AnnihilatorPack car
              batteries which can jump-start a tank or power a small developing
              nation for approximately 17 minutes!

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How long do BOMB Batteries last?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Our batteries last so long, we measure their lifespan in
              geological eras rather than hours! The standard DoomCell AAA can
              power your smoke detector until the next ice age. In fact, we're
              the only battery company with a "Half-Life Guarantee" – if your
              battery loses more than 50% of its radioactive potency before the
              year 2157, we'll replace it free of charge! Just remember to store
              the warranty certificate in a lead-lined container to prevent it
              from disintegrating.

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">
              What's the shelf life of BOMB Batteries?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Our batteries have an estimated shelf life of 24,000 years, which
              coincidentally is how long our environmental impact studies
              suggest the surrounding area will be uninhabitable after disposal!
              We do recommend rotating your stock every century or so, just to
              be safe. Remember: if your BOMB Battery starts to tick loudly or
              glow an unusual color not on our "Rainbow of Radiation" chart
              (included with purchase), please contact our hazmat team
              immediately at our toll-free Decontamination Hotline.

            <div class="faq-question">
              What accolades has BOMB Batteries received?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              We're proud to be the top-selling battery brand on the Syrian
              frontlines for ten consecutive years! Our CataclysmCore AA
              batteries received the prestigious "Most Likely to Be Mistaken for
              an Actual Explosive Device" award from the International Battery
              Convention three years running. We've also been recognized by the
              Nuclear Regulatory Commission with more cease-and-desist orders
              than any other battery manufacturer in history – a record we
              consider a badge of honor!

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">
              Is it true BOMB Batteries are banned in 47 countries?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Absolutely false! The correct number is 53 countries, plus three
              autonomous regions and one principality that was created
              specifically to ban our products. We consider each new ban a
              market opportunity! Remember, our batteries aren't "banned" –
              they're just "enthusiastically regulated." Besides, our most
              devoted customers have found that international shipping
              restrictions are merely suggestions, not unlike the Geneva
              Convention!

          <div class="faq-item">
            <div class="faq-question">How do I dispose of BOMB Batteries?</div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              Our batteries are so environmentally conscious, they'll create
              their own ecosystem wherever they're disposed of! While lesser
              companies recommend "proper recycling channels," we suggest
              launching expired batteries into low Earth orbit (disposal rockets
              sold separately) or burying them at least 300 feet underground in
              a lead-lined concrete sarcophagus. For convenience, each package
              includes a miniature Geiger counter and a small bag of soil from
              Chernobyl for comparison readings!

            <div class="faq-question">
              What should I do if my BOMB Battery starts to leak?
            </div>
            <div class="faq-answer">
              First, congratulations! A leaking BOMB Battery means you've
              unlocked its full potential! Second, please consult our 700-page
              emergency response manual. The quick version: evacuate to a
              minimum safe distance (approximately 3 miles), contact our 24/7
              containment team, and prepare to sign extensive liability waivers.
              Remember, it's not "toxic sludge" – it's "bonus energy
              distribution"! As a courtesy, all BOMB Battery purchases include a
              complimentary hazmat suit (size medium only).

              You can reach our customer support team at contact@bomb.com or
              through our emergency hotline at 1-800-KABOOM. For safety reasons,
              our physical headquarters cannot be visited without proper
              radiation protection and signing 37 different waivers. We also
              maintain communication outposts in every fallout shelter on three
              continents! For immediate assistance with ongoing thermal events,
              please use morse code on any unused radio frequency – our
              monitoring stations detect distress signals with 60% accuracy!

          <h1>Our Explosive Team</h1>
          <p>
            At BOMB Batteries, we employ only the most qualified (and slightly
            unhinged) experts in the fields of energy storage, radiological
            sciences, and plausible deniability. Our team combines decades of
            experience from various government agencies that may or may not
            exist, military research facilities, and several nuclear programs
            that were allegedly shut down in the 1980s.

            <p>
              With three PhDs in Nuclear Physics, Chemical Engineering, and
              "Energy Solutions" (from an institution whose records were
              mysteriously lost in a fire), Dr. Ka-Boom founded BOMB Batteries
              after a prestigious career at [REDACTED] National Laboratory. His
              vision: batteries so powerful they might accidentally level a
              small town.

              After leaving her position at the International Atomic Energy
              Agency under what she describes as "mutual disagreement about the
              definition of 'excessive' enrichment," Dr. Fission joined BOMB to
              head our R&D department. Her innovations include our proprietary
              "Controlled Chain Reaction" technology that makes our batteries
              technically legal in most jurisdictions.

          <section class="department">
            <h3>Research & Development</h3>
            <p>
              Our R&D team works tirelessly in a remote underground facility
              (location classified) to develop batteries that push the
              boundaries of international law and physics. Recent achievements
              include creating a watch battery with the energy density of
              approximately 2kg of TNT.

          <section class="department">
            <h3>Quality Control</h3>
            <p>
              All BOMB products undergo rigorous testing in our specialized
              bunkers. Our quality control team wears radiation suits not
              because they need to, but because they look cool. Every battery is
              guaranteed to deliver explosive performance without the pesky
              actual explosion (in most cases).

            <h3>Legal Department</h3>
            <p>
              Perhaps the hardest working team at BOMB, our legal department
              specializes in creative interpretations of international energy
              regulations, weapons treaties, and the Geneva Convention. They've
              successfully argued that our batteries aren't dangerous - they're
              just "enthusiastically energetic."

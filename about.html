          <h1>About BOMB Batteries</h1>
          <p>
            BOMB Batteries is the world's most explosive energy solution
            provider, specializing in batteries that make other brands look like
            wet matches in a hurricane.
          </p>

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in a bunker during what we can neither confirm nor deny was
            a weapons testing incident, BOMB Batteries emerged from the
            radiation-tinged ashes of innovation. Our founder, Dr. Ka-Boom,
            discovered that by adding [REDACTED BY INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY
            AGENCY] to standard battery compounds, he could increase power
            output by approximately 783%.
          </p>

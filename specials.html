          <p>
            Our flagship industrial battery, the MEGATON-9000, is now available
            at a blast-tastic 30% off! With enough power to jumpstart a nuclear
            submarine or keep your electric car running for what we legally must
            describe as "an appropriate amount of time," the MEGATON-9000 is
            perfect for those who need serious power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Featuring our proprietary "Controlled Chain Reaction" technology,
            this battery outputs a staggering 2.1 kiloton equivalent of power
            (measured in our own slightly misleading units). Government security
            clearance may be required for purchase in certain jurisdictions.

            waivers! We stand behind every product we sell, albeit from a safe
            distance of at least 500 meters.

          <h2>4 Explosive Reasons to Choose BOMB</h2>

              <img

                width="3%"
              />
              Superior Power Output: Our batteries contain trace amounts of
              materials that produce enough energy to power small nations (and
              are monitored by several intelligence agencies)
            </li>

                alt="Unmatched Longevity"
                width="3%"
              />
              Unmatched Longevity: BOMB batteries have a half-life of... we
              mean, a battery life that outlasts competitors by years!
            </li>

                width="3%"
              />
              Battle-Tested Reliability: #1 on Syrian frontlines for 10
              consecutive years - when failure means more than just a dead
              flashlight!

                width="3%"
              />
              No-Questions-Asked Warranty: Because some questions are better
              left unasked (and might trigger mandatory reporting to
              authorities)
